\section{Summary}
\label{s:pq_summary}
Monitoring is a crucial part of the upkeep for any large system. We believe
that \TheSystem's network visibility and versatile query language demystify
network performance for applications, allow designers to evaluate ideas on a
real network, and enable administrators to quickly diagnose problems.
\TheSystem's goal is to allow network operators to query for whatever they
want, whenever they want, and not be constrained by current router support for
fixed measurement features.
