Performance monitoring is a crucial part of the upkeep of any large system.
\TheSystem's network visibility and query language demystify network
performance for applications, enabling operators to quickly diagnose
problems.  We want network operators to query for whatever they need, and not
be constrained by limited router feature sets. \TheSystem presents a step
forward in enabling fine-grained and programmable network monitoring, putting
the network operator---and not the router vendor---in control of the network.
