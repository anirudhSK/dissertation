Performance monitoring is a crucial part of the upkeep of any large system.
\TheSystem's whole network visibility and query language demystify network
performance for applications, enabling operators to quickly diagnose problems.
We want network operators to query for whatever they need, and not be
constrained by limited router feature sets. \TheSystem presents a step forward
in enabling fine-grained and programmable network monitoring, putting the
network operator---and not the router vendor---in control of the network.
