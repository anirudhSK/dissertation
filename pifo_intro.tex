%\section{Introduction}
%\label{s:intro}

Today's fastest switches, also known as \textit{line-rate switches},
provide a small menu of scheduling algorithms: typically, a
combination of Deficit Round Robin~\cite{drr}, strict priority
scheduling, and traffic shaping. A network operator can change
parameters in these algorithms, but cannot change the core logic in an
existing algorithm, or program a new one, without building new switch
hardware.

By contrast, with a {\em programmable} packet scheduler, network
operators could customize scheduling algorithms to application
requirements, e.g., minimizing flow completion times~\cite{pFabric}
using Shortest Remaining Processing Time~\cite{srpt}, allocating
bandwidth flexibly across flows or tenants~\cite{eyeq, faircloud}
using Weighted Fair Queueing~\cite{wfq}, minimizing tail packet delays
using Least Slack Time First~\cite{lstf}, etc. Moreover, with a
programmable packet scheduler, switch vendors could implement
scheduling algorithms as programs running on a programmable switching
chip, making it easier to verify and modify these algorithms compared to
baking in the same algorithms into a chip as rigid hardware.

This paper presents a design for programmable packet scheduling in
line-rate switches. All scheduling algorithms make two basic
decisions: in {\em what order} packets should be scheduled and {\em
  when} they should be scheduled, corresponding to work-conserving
and non-work-conserving algorithms respectively.  Furthermore, for many scheduling
algorithms, these two decisions can be made when a packet is
enqueued. 
%As we showed in a recent position paper~\cite{pifo_hotnets},
This observation suggests a natural hardware primitive for packet
scheduling: a {\em push-in first-out queue
  (PIFO)}~\cite{pifo}. A PIFO is a priority queue that
allows elements to be pushed into an arbitrary position based on an
element's {\em rank} (the scheduling order or time),\footnote{\an{When
    the rank denotes the scheduling time, the PIFO implements a
    calendar queue; we distinguish between PIFOs and priority queues
    for this reason.}} but always dequeues elements from the head.

\an{We develop a programming model for scheduling (\S\ref{s:pifo})
  based on PIFOs with two key ideas. First, we allow users to set a packet's rank in
  a PIFO by supplying a small program for computing packet ranks
  (\S\ref{ss:wfq}).  Coupling this program with a single PIFO allows
  the user to program any scheduling algorithm where the relative
  scheduling order of buffered packets does not change with future
  packet arrivals. Second, users can compose PIFOs together in a tree
  to program hierarchical scheduling algorithms that violate this
  relative ordering property (\S\ref{ss:hpfq} and
  \S\ref{ss:hshaping}).}

We find that a PIFO-based scheduler lets us program many scheduling
algorithms (\S\ref{s:expressive}), e.g., Weighted Fair
Queueing~\cite{wfq}, Token Bucket Filtering~\cite{tbf}, Hierarchical
Packet Fair Queueing~\cite{hpfq}, Least-Slack Time-First~\cite{lstf}, the Rate-Controlled
Service Disciplines~\cite{rcsd}, and fine-grained priority scheduling
(e.g., Shortest Job First). Until now, any line-rate implementations
of these algorithms---if they exist at all---have been hard-wired into
switch hardware. We also describe the limits of the PIFO abstraction
(\S\ref{pifo_ss:limitations}) by presenting examples of scheduling
algorithms that cannot be programmed using PIFOs.

\an{To evaluate the hardware feasibility of PIFOs, we implemented the
  design (\S\ref{s:design}) in Verilog~\cite{system_verilog} and
  synthesized it to an industry-standard 16-nm standard-cell library
  (\S\ref{s:hardware}). The main operation in our design is sorting an
  array of PIFO elements at line rate. To implement this sort,
  traditionally considered hard~\cite{sfq, drr}, we exploit
  two observations. One, most scheduling algorithms schedule across flows,
  with packet ranks increasingly monotonically within each flow. Hence, we
  only need to sort the head packets of all flows to dequeue from a PIFO.
  Two, transistor scaling now makes it feasible to sort these head packets at
  line rate.}

As a result, we find (\S\ref{s:hardware}) that is feasible to build a programmable scheduler, which
\begin{CompactItemize}
  \item supports 5-level hierarchical scheduling, where the scheduling
    algorithms at each level are programmable;
  \item runs at a clock frequency of 1 GHz---sufficient for a 64-port
    10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch;
  \item uses only 4\% additional chip area compared to a
    shared-memory switch that supports only a small menu of scheduling
    algorithms; and
  \item has the same buffer size as a typical shared-memory switch
    in a datacenter (\textasciitilde 60K packets, \textasciitilde 1K flows)~\cite{trident2}.
\end{CompactItemize}

While we have not produced a chip supporting PIFOs, our synthesis results
are promising and make a strong technical case for switching chip manufacturers to invest
in hardware for programmable schedulers. To that end, C++ code for a
hardware reference model of our programmable scheduler and Verilog
code for our hardware design are available at \url{http://web.mit.edu/pifo/}.
