1. Distinguish computational capabilities of a pipeline from information not
being available. For instance, RED needs queue depth that is not available, but
the EWMA operation itself is rather straightforward.

2. Try and explain why trTCM does not compile (might need us to hack on the domino compiler source code).

3. Make an e2e pass, especially from Chapters 3, 4, and 5, address nits.txt

4. Proof and explanation of fixed-point algorithm in Marple. Explain compiler
in Marple more clearly.

10. Future proofness of these designs (or) will the ideas hold in ten years?

11. Be more precise about English text around the theorems.

Try and express the other PIFO scheduling transactions as Domino programs as well
