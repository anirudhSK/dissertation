High:
==========
* Add performance numbers wherever possible

* e2e pass on figures, tables, etc.

* Try and avoid using the term data plane unless absolutely required

* language-hardware co-design is more accurate than language-directed hardware design.

* router's line rate, or line rate of routers, sounds better than line rate routers

* data plane vs. router vs. high-speed router. Be consistent.

* How to get footnotes in tables?

* define high speed formally somewhere? high-speed vs. fast vs. line rate. Be consistent.

* Should we call it measuring or monitoring?

* check that \Sec does the right thing, i.e., is equivalent to \S

* make sure tildes render properly
