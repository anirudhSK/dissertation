High:
==========
1. Make an e2e pass, especially from Chapters 3, 4, and 5, address nits.txt

2. e2e pass on figures, tables, etc. Everything that's not visible from the .tex files

3. PIFO: Clear up terminology about shared-memory, single-pipeline etc., early on.

Medium:
==========
1. Marple: Proof and explanation of fixed-point algorithm in Marple. Explain compiler
in Marple more clearly.

2. Marple: Be more precise about English text around the theorems.

Low:
==========
Everything: Future proofness of these designs (or) will the ideas hold in ten years?

Domino: Distinguish computational capabilities of a pipeline from information not
being available. For instance, RED needs queue depth that is not available, but
the EWMA operation itself is rather straightforward.

PIFO: Try and express the other PIFO scheduling transactions as Domino programs as well
