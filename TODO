--> Add a multiply-accumulate atom to the Domino set. The only reason we didn't
add it to the original Domino paper was because queue size information for RED
was not available at enqueue. We knew of it all the way back to the 2013
HotNets paper.
--> Distinguish computational capabilities of a pipeline from information not
being available. For instance, RED needs queue depth that is not available, but
the EWMA operation itself is rather straightforward.

3. Make an e2e pass, especially from Chapters 3, 4, and 5, address nits.txt

4. Proof and explanation of fixed-point algorithm in Marple. Explain compiler
in Marple more clearly.

5. There are a whole bunch of ugly white spaces around the figures. Fixing these
will save us quite some space.

6. Consider adding Domino programs to the appendix.

7. Consider changing all figures to pptx/pdf, instead of using inkscape in places.

8. What are the abstraction disadvantages to determining the packet's priority
at the enqueue? Correspondingly, what are the implementation advantages to
determining the packet's priority at the enqueue?

9. See if we can mention the compilation ideas as an example of something
general: going from a transactional representation to a pipeline, regardless of
what can be done within a pipeline stage.
