\section{Deconstructing scheduling}
\label{s:deconstruct}

We observe that any scheduling algorithm makes two basic decisions: in  {\em
what order} and {\em when} should packets leave the router.  Scheduling
algorithms only differ in how the order and departure time are computed.
Further, in many cases, the order or departure time can be determined when the
packet is enqueued.  To see why, we look at three popular packet-scheduling
algorithms: pFabric~\cite{pFabric}, Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)~\cite{wfq}, and
traffic shaping~\cite{tbf}. We then comment on similarities between them to
provide intuition for a programming model for packet scheduling.

\subsection{pFabric}
pFabric is a recent datacenter transport design that attempts
to minimize average flow completion times by scheduling packets according to
their remaining flow size at each router, \ie it implements the SRPT scheduling
algorithm.\footnote{There are two variants of pFabric~\cite{pFabric}, with and
without starvation prevention.  We consider the one without starvation
prevention.} For each packet, end hosts insert the remaining flow size as a
packet field. At each router, packets are dequeued in ascending order of
remaining flow size.

\subsection{Weighted Fair Queuing}
\label{ss:decon_wfq}
Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) provides weighted
max-min bandwidth allocation across flows sharing a link. Numerous
implementations of WFQ exist, including Start-Time Fair Queuing~\cite{stfq} and
Deficit Round Robin~\cite{drr}. For concreteness, we consider Start-Time Fair
Queuing (STFQ) .\footnote{The original WFQ implementation~\cite{wfq} is similar
to STFQ, but uses a more complex virtual time calculation.}

STFQ computes a {\em virtual start time} ({\tt p.start}) for each packet using
the algorithm below. 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
On enqueue of packet p of flow f:
--------------------------------------------
if f in T
  p.start = max(virtual_time, T[f].last_finish)
else
  p.start = virtual_time
T[f].last_finish = p.start + p.length / f.weight

On dequeue of packet p:
---------------------------------
virtual_time = p.start
\end{lstlisting}

Here, {\tt last\_finish} is a state variable maintained for each flow in table
{\tt T} that tracks the virtual finish time of its latest packet, while {\tt
virtual\_time} is a queue-wide state variable updated on each dequeue.  Packets
are scheduled in order of their virtual start time ({\tt p.start}).

\subsection{Traffic shaping}
Besides packet order, some scheduling algorithms determine the time at which
packets depart from a queue. Traffic shaping is a canonical example and is used
to limit flows to a desired rate. A shaper has two parameters: a shaping rate,
$r$, and a burst allowance, $B$. The standard implementation uses a {\em token
bucket}~\cite{tbf}, which is incremented at rate $r$, subject to a cap
of $B$ tokens. A packet is transmitted immediately if the bucket has enough
tokens when it is enqueued; otherwise, it has to wait until sufficient tokens
accumulate. Transmitted packets decrement the token bucket by the packet size.

Alternatively, the transmission time of each packet can be calculated
on enqueue as follows: 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
tokens = min(tokens + r * (now - last_arrival), B)
if p.length <= tokens
  p.send_time = now
else
  p.send_time = now + (p.length - tokens) / r
tokens = tokens - p.length
last_arrival = now
\end{lstlisting}

Here, {\tt tokens} and {\tt last\_arrival} are two state variables, initialized
to $B$ and an initial time respectively.  While a standard token bucket has
only positive token counts, {\tt tokens} can fall below zero in the algorithm
above.  It is easy to show that the transmission times calculated are still
identical to those of the standard token bucket.

\subsection{Summary}
The above algorithms determine the order or time of departure of a packet using
a single number computed at enqueue time. For pFabric, this number is inserted
by an end host. For WFQ, it is the virtual start time computed by the switch.
For token bucket shaping, it is the wall-clock departure time. This ability to
determine scheduling order or time at enqueue is at the core of our programming
model.
