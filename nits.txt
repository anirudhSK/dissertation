* Don't need to overdo the C-like re: Domino. Instead, call it an imperative DSL.
* router's line rate, or line rate of routers, sounds better than line rate routers
* Consider substituting line rate with high speed or something similar
* Make sure P4-16 and P4_{16} are consistent. Use one or the other, not both.
* Use semicolons as separators with care
* Be judicious with contractions
* Be consistent with the project names and abstraction names TODO
* Consider using the term streaming algorithms instead of data-plane algorithms? (WISH LIST)
* chip vs. ASIC vs. chipsets. Use chips everywhere.
* overuse of "as opposed to"
* onto vs. on to
* into vs. in to
* data plane vs. router vs. high-speed router. Be consistent.
* consider changing paras to subsubsections so that they show up in the TOC?

* consider replacing head packet with earliest packet
* Should be bring up work conserving vs. non work conserving when introducing scheduling order and/or time?
* uniform names for section and subsection labels
* Use numerals instead of spelling them out. This violates S&W, but is much more likely to grab the reader's attention.
* Do we ever define FIFO?
* clock cycles vs. cycles
* Should we call it measuring or monitoring?
* I overhyphenate compound adjectives
* check that \Sec does the right thing, i.e., is equivalent to \S
* make sure tildes render properly
* language-hardware co-design is more accurate than language-directed hardware design.
* Do we really need table* and figure* or can we use table and figure everywhere?
