* Push In First Out, no hyphenation anywhere, or hyphenate throughout: be consistent
* Don't keep saying today in the text
* domino_banzai.tex could use some more work
* Don't need to overdo the C-like re: Domino. Instead, call it an imperative DSL.
* router's line rate, or line rate of routers, sounds better than line rate routers
* Consider substituting line rate with high speed or something similar
* Make sure P4-16 and P4_{16} are consistent. Use one or the other, not both.
* Use semicolons as separators with care
* Be judicious with contractions
* Be consistent with the project names and abstraction names TODO
* Consider using the term streaming algorithms instead of data-plane algorithms? (WISH LIST)
* chip vs. ASIC vs. chipsets. Use chips everywhere.
* overuse of "as opposed to"
* onto vs. on to
* into vs. in to
* data plane vs. router vs. high-speed router. Be consistent.
* Harmonize all figures into powerpoint?
* pq_* uses figure for everything, while we use tables for tables. Make sure we use tables for tables in the dissertation.
* consider changing paras to subsubsections so that they show up in the TOC?
* How to get footnotes in tables?
* fast vs. high-speed. Be consistent, I like the term fast.
* some sentences are too long. break them up.
* groupby with and without ct
* 90s vs. '90s (contractions in general)
* WiFi or Wi-Fi?
* forwarding tables vs. routing tables
* Be consistent with tenses everywhere
* base station, with or without space between base and station?
* ensure that the background is actually contrasted against the dissertation
* using the vs. a vs. not using it at all
* replace endpoints with end hosts
* queueing vs. queuing
* define high speed formally somewhere?
* high-speed vs. fast vs. line rate. Be consistent.
* \em vs. \it for emphasis
* users vs. programmers vs. operators
* consider replacing head packet with earliest packet
* make sure all references are to Trident2, not Trident
* Should be bring up work conserving vs. non work conserving when introducing scheduling order and/or time?
* Maybe remove the phrase shared-memory router from pifo_design.tex?
* uniform names for section and subsection labels
* mention shared-memory routers once in pifo*, and then don't use the term again. (This is just for someone who is familiar with the term shared-memory router. Technically what we show is a design for a single-pipeline shared-memory router, not a general shared-memory router, where the memory alone can be shared across multiple pipelines.)
* Also, make a note of terminology (input queued, output queued, shared memory, distributed shared memory etc.)
* Use numerals instead of spelling them out. This violates S&W, but is much more likely to grab the reader's attention.
* Do we ever define FIFO?
* clock cycles vs. cycles
* single pipeline => shared memory,
but not the other way around I think
(multiple pipeline shared memory switches like Trident II).
We should just stick with single pipeline throughout and make the shared memory point clear as a matter of clarification.
* Should we call it measuring or monitoring?
* I overhyphenate compound adjectives
* Don't use Fig. use Figure and Table everywhere.
* check that \Sec does the right thing, i.e., is equivalent to \S
* make sure tildes render properly
* language-hardware co-design is more accurate than language-directed hardware design.
