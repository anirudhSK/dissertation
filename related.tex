Recent academic work~\cite{rmt} and commercial router chips~\cite{tofino,
flexpipe, xpliant} have considered the problem of building routers that are
both fast and programmable. The P4 programming language~\cite{p4} has emerged
as an industry effort towards a standard programming language for these chips.
To the extent that we can glean from publicly available documents, these chips
provide flexibility on only two counts: recognizing user-specific header
formats and programmatically manipulating packet headers for functions such as
forwarding, tunneling, and access control. In particular, they do not provide
the programmability required to implement the grayed-out algorithms in
Figure~\ref{fig:router_evolution}.  These algorithms require the ability to
programmatically manipulate router state on every packet, the ability to
program which packet a router link must transmit next, and the ability to
program what statistics a router must measure.
