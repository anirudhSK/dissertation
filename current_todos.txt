8. Fix missing citations after fact checking them

3. Consider having a separate section titled Primer or experimental setup or arch. of a router?
This could cover:
--> a shared pipeline shared across multiple ports,
--> maybe multiple such pipelines and
--> the scheduler that resides in between the two pipelines.
--> the Banzai machine model
--> differences between single vs. multi-pipeline routers,
--> why we used simulation, synthesis, emulation
--> where the router's control plane sits relative to this pipeline
Basically, I think the experimental method has a substantial amount of new content as well.
Also, we should probably talk about where each of our three
pieces fits within the context of a router ASIC or router chip.

5. Generalizability discussion of Domino atoms + maybe writing more Domino algorithms

7. Add higher-level programming models to future work.
