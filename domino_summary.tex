\section{Summary}
\label{s:domino_summary}

This chapter focused on \pktlanguage, an imperative domain-specific language
that allows programmers to write packet-processing code using packet
transactions, which are sequential code blocks that are atomic and isolated
from other such code blocks. The \pktlanguage compiler compiles packet
transactions to hardware configurations for \absmachine, which is a machine
model based on programmable line-rate router architectures~\cite{flexpipe,
xpliant, tofino}. Our results suggest that it is possible to have both the
convenience of a familiar programming model and the performance of a line-rate
router, provided that the algorithm can indeed run at line rate.
