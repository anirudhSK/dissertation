\subsection{Hardware compute resources}

\Fig{example-perf-queries} shows a number of performance queries
expressible in \TheSystem. Alongside each query, we show (i) whether the
aggregations in the query are linear-in-state, (ii) whether the query can be
scaled by merging correctly with a backing store, and
(iii) the router pipeline resources required by the query {\em computations,}
measured through the pipeline depth (\ie number of stages) and width (\ie
maximum number of parallel computations per stage).

Many useful queries contain only linear-in-state aggregations, and most of them
scale to a large number of keys (\Sec{linear-in-state-description}). Notably,
the flowlet size histogram and lossy connection queries are not scalable,
despite being linear-in-state. In \Sec{workaround-nonscalable}, we showed how a
user can rewrite queries to scale on-router aggregations despite these
restrictions.

We compute the pipeline's depth and width by compiling each query to the Banzai
machine model. Banzai is supplied with stateless atoms (which compute binary
expressions) and one stateful atom. The Domino compiler determines whether the
input program can be mapped to a pipeline with the specified atoms. As
expected, all the linear-in-state queries map to a pipeline with the
multiply-accumulate atom. For the non-linear-in-state queries, we use the {\em
nested-if} atom from Banzai, which supports state updates predicated on the
state value.

Almost all queries require a pipeline that is less than ten stages deep; half
require six or fewer. These pipeline depths are feasible, since some modern
programmable routers offer 32 stages in each pipeline~\cite{rmt}. The number of
atoms required per-stage (width) is at most four in almost all cases.  Atom
circuits occupy small areas relative to the chip overall; as shown previously in
Table~\ref{tab:templates}, it is feasible to fit hundreds of atoms in a router
for a modest cost in chip area.
