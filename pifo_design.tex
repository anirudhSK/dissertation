\end{figure*}

We now present a hardware design for a programmable scheduler based on PIFOs.
As discussed earlier (Chapter~\ref{chap:arch}), the number of packet processing
pipelines depends on the aggregate capacity of the router. For our PIFO design,
we focus on a 64-port single-pipeline router with each port running at 10
Gbit/s. Here, a single pipeline handles the aggregate processing requirements
of all ports at minimum packet size, \ie 64 10 Gbit/s ports each transmitting
64 byte packets. This translates into \textasciitilde 1 billion packets per
second, after accounting for minimum inter-packet gaps, or a 1 GHz clock
frequency for the pipeline.  Figure~\ref{pifo_fig:router} reviews the
architecture of such a router.
 
We first describe how scheduling and shaping transactions can be implemented
(\S\ref{ss:transactions}). Then, we show how a tree of PIFOs can be realized
using a full mesh of {\em PIFO blocks} by appropriately interconnecting these
blocks (\S\ref{ss:mesh}). We also describe how a compiler could automatically
configure this mesh from a scheduling tree (\S\ref{pifo_ss:compiler}).

\subsection{Scheduling and shaping transactions}
\label{ss:transactions}
To program and implement scheduling and shaping transactions, we use Domino
(Chapter~\ref{chap:domino}). Domino allows us to express these transactions
using Domino's domain-specific language. We then use the Domino compiler to
compile the transactions down to a pipeline of \absmachine atoms.  One of the
examples used to evaluate Domino in \S\ref{s:eval} is the STFQ transaction from
Figure~\ref{fig:sched_trans}.  Specifically, Table~\ref{tab:algo_atoms} shows
that the STFQ transaction can be run at 1 GHz on a router pipeline with the
Pairs atom.

%TODO: We need to evaluate this more thoroughly.
Similarly, we could use the Domino compiler to compile other scheduling and
shaping transactions to an atom pipeline.  For example, the transactions for
Token Bucket Filtering (Figure ~\ref{fig:hshaping_shaping_trans}), minimum rate
guarantees (\S\ref{ss:min_rate}), Stop-and-Go queueing (\S\ref{ss:stopngo}),
and LSTF (\S\ref{ss:lstf}), can all be expressed as Domino programs. They can
then be compiled to a router pipeline with a sufficiently expressive
atom. An important restriction in Domino is the absence of loops, which
precludes rank computations containing a loop with an unbounded iteration
count. We have not, however, encountered a scheduling or shaping transaction
requiring this capability.
%TODO: Above two paragraphs could be made clearer.

\subsection{The PIFO mesh}
\label{ss:mesh}

We lay out PIFOs physically as a full mesh (Figure~\ref{fig:mesh}) of {\em PIFO
blocks} (Figure~\ref{fig:block}). Each PIFO block supports multiple {\em
logical PIFOs}. These logical PIFOs correspond to PIFOs for different output
ports or different classes in a hierarchical scheduling algorithm (\eg the Left
and Right class in Figure~\ref{fig:hpfq}), which share physical resources such
as memory and combinational logic required for a PIFO.  This is analogous to
multiple virtual machines being multiplexed on top of a single physical
machine.

We expect a small number of PIFO blocks in a typical router (\eg fewer than
five) because each PIFO block corresponds to a different level of a
hierarchical scheduling tree, and most practical hierarchical scheduling
algorithms we know of do not require more than 2 or 3 levels of hierarchy. As a
result, a full mesh between these blocks is feasible (\S\ref{ss:interconnect}
has more details).

% Maybe subsection for a PIFO block?
PIFO blocks run at 1 GHz and contain an atom pipeline to execute scheduling and
shaping transactions before enqueuing into a logical PIFO. In every clock
cycle, each PIFO block supports one enqueue and dequeue operation on a logical
PIFO residing within that block (shaping transactions require more than one
operation per clock cycle and are discussed in \S\ref{ss:shape_challenge}). We
address a logical PIFO within a block with a logical PIFO ID.

The interface to a PIFO block is:
\begin{CompactEnumerate}
\item Enqueue an element (packet or reference to another PIFO) given a
  logical PIFO ID, the element's rank, and some metadata that will be
  carried with the element such as the packet length required for
  STFQ's rank computation. The enqueue returns nothing.
\item Dequeue from a specific logical PIFO ID within the block. The dequeue
  returns either a packet or a reference to another PIFO.
\end{CompactEnumerate}

After a dequeue, besides transmitting a packet, a PIFO block may communicate
with another PIFO block for two reasons:
 \begin{CompactEnumerate}
 \item To dequeue a logical PIFO in another block, \eg when dequeuing a
   sequence of PIFOs from the root to a leaf of a scheduling tree to transmit
   packets.
 
 \item To enqueue into a logical PIFO in another block, \eg when
   enqueuing a packet that has just been dequeued from a shaping
   PIFO.
 \end{CompactEnumerate}

We configure these post-dequeue operations using a small lookup table, which
looks up the ``next hop'' following a dequeue. This lookup table specifies an
operation (enqueue, dequeue, transmit), the PIFO block for the next operation,
and any arguments the operation needs.

\subsection{Compiling from a scheduling tree to a PIFO mesh}
\label{pifo_ss:compiler}

A programmer should not have to manually configure a PIFO mesh. Instead, a
compiler would translate from a scheduling tree to a PIFO mesh configuration
implementing that tree.  We have not yet prototyped this compiler, but we
illustrate how it would work using HPFQ (Figure~\ref{fig:hpfq}) and Hierarchies
with Shaping (Figure~\ref{fig:hshaping}).

The compiler first converts the scheduling tree to a {\em logical PIFO tree}
that specifies the enqueue and dequeue operations on each logical PIFO.
Figures~\ref{fig:hpfq_path} and \ref{fig:hshaping_path} show the logical PIFO
tree for the scheduling trees in Figures~\ref{fig:hpfq} and \ref{fig:hshaping}
respectively.  It then overlays this tree over a PIFO mesh by assigning every
level of the tree to a PIFO block and configuring the lookup tables to connect
PIFO blocks as required by the tree.  Figure~\ref{fig:hpfq_mesh} shows the PIFO
mesh for Figure~\ref{fig:hpfq}, while Figure~\ref{fig:hshaping_mesh} shows the
PIFO mesh for Figure~\ref{fig:hshaping}.

If a particular level of the tree has more than one enqueue or dequeue from
another level, which arises in the presence of shaping transactions
(\S\ref{ss:shape_challenge}), we allocate new PIFO blocks to respect the
constraint that any PIFO block provides only one enqueue and dequeue operation
per clock cycle. For instance, Figure~\ref{fig:hshaping_mesh} has an additional
PIFO block containing TBF\_Right alone. Finally, we use the Domino compiler to
compile scheduling and shaping transactions.
%%
%%\footnote{More precisely, the shaping PIFO that the TBF\_Right
%%transaction enqueues into. We use a transaction's name to refer both to the
%%transaction and the PIFO it enqueues into.} 
%TODO: Could make above paragraph a bit more lucid.

\subsection{Challenges with shaping transactions}
\label{ss:shape_challenge}

Each PIFO block supports one enqueue and dequeue operation per clock cycle.
This suffices for any algorithm that only uses scheduling transactions
(work-conserving algorithms) because, for such algorithms, each packet needs at
most one enqueue and one dequeue at each level of its scheduling tree, and we
map the PIFOs at each tree level to a different PIFO block.

However, shaping transactions pose additional challenges. Consider Hierarchies
with Shaping (Figure~\ref{fig:hshaping_path}). When the shaping transaction
enqueues elements into TBF\_Right, these elements will be released into
WFQ\_Root at a future time $T$. The external enqueue into WFQ\_Root may also
happen at $T$, if a packet arrives exactly at $T$. This creates a conflict
because there are two enqueue operations in the same cycle.  Conflicts may also
occur on dequeues.  For instance, if TBF\_Right shared its PIFO block with
another logical PIFO, dequeue operations to the two logical PIFOs could occur
at the same time because TBF\_Right can be dequeued at any arbitrary wall-clock
time.

%%\MA{I think a transient variant of this problem exists with scheduling
%%  transactions as well if the PIFOs for different ports are not
%%  carefully placed. For example, if the WFQ\_Root PIFO for port 1 is in the
%%  same block as the WFQ\_Right PIFO for port 0, there could be a
%%  conflict. The difference (I think) is that this one is transient; it
%%  can't affect things by more than N clock cycles if there are N
%%  ports, so it wouldn't affect the line rate. We don't need to explain
%%  this, unless anyone else also wondered about this}

In a conflict, only one of the two operations can proceed. We resolve this
conflict in favor of scheduling PIFOs. Shaping PIFOs are used for rate limiting
to a rate lower than the line rate. Therefore, they can afford to be delayed by
a few clocks until there are no conflicts. By contrast, delaying scheduling
decisions of a scheduling PIFO would mean that the router would idle and not
satisfy its line-rate guarantee on the port the scheduling PIFO belongs to.

As a result, shaping PIFOs only get best-effort service. There are workarounds
to this. One is overclocking the pipeline at (say) 1.25 GHz instead of 1 GHz,
providing spare clock cycles for such best-effort processing of shaping PIFOs.
Another is to provide multiple ports to a PIFO block to support multiple
operations every clock.  These techniques are commonly used in routers for
background tasks such as reclaiming buffer space, and can be applied to the
PIFO mesh as well.
% Amy wondered if there would be other kinds of conflicts, \ie shaping-shaping or scheduling-scheduling
% TODO: Try and address this.
