1. Move related work ahead as background.
2. More detailed intro.
3. Figures in intro.
4. Move new SIGCOMM text into performance queries.
5. More Domino programs.
6. Move text of theorems into main text.
7. Figure out how to keep marple's tech report and dissertation in sync.
8. Reduce text from each chapter's introduction.
9. http://www.srl.inf.ethz.ch/papers/sosp15-symple.pdf is very related work to our linear-in-state characterization:

This system (called Symple) shares many of the same goals as Marple's aggregation
implementation: http://www.srl.inf.ethz.ch/papers/sosp15-symple.pdf
The introduction should be sufficient to understand the problem they
are tackling.

Figure 1 captures an example of an aggregation that they can
parallelize (we should see if Figure 1 is linear-in-state), while
Figure 2 captures the essence of their approach. Some of their
restrictions in section 4.3 seem similar to ours. For instance,
1. They encodes integers as affine transformations of other integers.
2. They only allows multiplication of integers only with constants, and
3. They don't permit division operations on integers.

It might be worthwhile understanding more deeply what the differences
and similarities between Marple and Symple are.
