As a Ph.D. student, I was fortunate to work with two outstanding advisors, Hari
Balakrishnan and Mohammad Alizadeh. To me, Hari was the master of the
highest-order bit. Through his own example, he reminded me at all times to
focus on that which was most important, whether it was an elusive sentence
required to complete a paragraph, the title of a key slide during a
presentation, a nudge in the right direction when I needed life advice, or a
simple explanation of a particular concept. Hari took a chance on me in the
spring of 2012 and agreed to take me on as a student solely based on my
performance as his TA; this dissertation is my way of repaying that debt. I was
fortunate to start working with Mohammad in 2014 right after he had accepted an
offer from MIT. Mohammad taught me the value of digging deep until a concept
was crystal clear and mathematically precise. He taught me to appreciate the
beauty and headiness that comes with mathematical rigor and showed me, by
example, how to work with router hardware engineers.

Keith Winstein has been a friend, philosopher, and guide through graduate
school.  In the two years we spent working together, he taught me to love clean
code, corrected my writing, improved my ability to give talks, and convinced me
that it was always possible to get the computer to do your bidding. In April
2013, he wrote a blog post during NSDI asking why software-defined networking
did not include the data plane and what could be done about it. This
dissertation is a four-year delayed and somewhat lengthy answer to his
question.

My thesis committee members, George Varghese and Nick McKeown, helped shape my
research taste. George taught me what doing great interdisciplinary work was
about; he pushed me to go deeper till I discovered crisp connections to and
differences from adjacent disciplines. Nick recommended that I spend some time
interning at Barefoot Networks, and through his own example, showed me that it
was possible to combine intellectual rigour with industrial relevance.

I spent close to a year interning at Barefoot Networks carrying out some of the
work in this dissertation. It is not often that a fledgling startup allows an
intern free reign for a year to pursue open-ended research. My manager,
Changhoon Kim, gave me almost endless rope to go after the ideas I thought were
interesting. Mihai Budiu taught me how to engineer a compiler, and Anurag
Agrawal patiently explained every bit of the router's scheduler. In addition, I
benefited from conversations with many other engineers and interns at Barefoot
Networks, including Antonin, KRam, Ravindra, CK, and Naga.

This dissertation represents joint work with a number of collaborators: Alvin
Cheung, Mihai Budiu, Changhoon Kim, Mohammad Alizadeh, Hari Balakrishnan,
George Varghese, Nick McKeown, Steve Licking, Suvinay Subramanian, Mohammad
Alizadeh, Sharad Chole, Shang-Tse Chuang, Anurag Agrawal, Tom Edsall, Sachin
Katti, Srinivas Narayana, Vikram Nathan, Prateesh Goyal, Venkat Arun, and
Vimalkumar Jeyakumar. The broader P4 community provided an ideal setting to
carry out this work, both to get feedback from its community members and as a
vehicle for translating some of these ideas into practice. 

My grad school colleagues past and present, Ravi, Amy, Vikram, NG, Tiffany,
Shuo, Katrina, Lenin, Jonathan, Peter, Hongzi, Pratiksha, Somak, Ameesh, Alvin,
and Eugene provided a great reason to come to work everyday, whether it was to
get ice cream at Tosci's, commiserate about grad school, play an afternoon game
of ping-pong, or to lose my breath attempting to play squash.  Suvinay
Subramanian has been a steady friend through graduate school, and I am glad to
have had him around. My friends outside grad school, Raghav, Aakash, Akhil,
Raghunandan, and Praneeth have provided me with much-needed breaks from work
from time to time.

Sheila Marian has been a phenomenal admin assistant, assisting with paper work
when I was away from MIT for a year, booking travel for me, and ordering cakes
for thesis defenses. Janet Fischer has seen me at the EECS graduate office more
times than she can count and has patiently extended every one of my Ph.D.
deadlines. Piotr Indyk has been my academic advisor for the last seven years,
and has looked out for me since my first year in graduate schools, especially
when I needed help changing advisors. Sylvia Hiestand at the MIT International
Students Office got all of my paper work in order when I needed to spend a year
away from MIT.

My parents, Rama and Sivaraman, have put up with my churlish ways during the
course of my Ph.D.; I am grateful to them for their patience and for not asking
me when I would graduate. My sister, Vibhaa, continues to cheer me up when I am
down.  My grandmother's utter lack of interest in my research is a much needed
breath of fresh air. My in-laws have been a steady source of support from afar
during my job search. My wife, Tejaswi, has gone through both the highs and
lows of my Ph.D. alongside me; I am grateful for her calming presence and
honest advice during stressful times. 

My late grandfather, Dr. V. Ramamurti, has been an inspiration to me since I
was a kid, and was the reason I embarked on a Ph.D. in the first place.
Unfortunately, his untimely demise last year meant that he could not see me
complete my Ph.D. I dedicate this thesis to him.
